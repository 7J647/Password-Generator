# Password-Generator website project

## Description 

We were instructed to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.  These criteria consisted of a) a specified number of characters between "8" and "124", whether the user wanted Uppercase letters included, whether the user wanted lowercase letters included, whether the user wanted numerals included, and whether the user wanted special characters included.

This information is collected from a series prompts that the user encounters upon visiting the website.  The character pool is initially stored in different arrays and then each character type chosen by the user is pushed into a new array combining all of the characters that the user wants to include.

The password is then generated by randomly selecting the number of characters specified by the user, from this new array of eligible pool characters.  This password is then alerted back to the user.

This project demonstrated the effectiveness of good pseudocoding because once the steps are outlined they are easier to combine into code.  At this stage of my programming career I had a difficult time setting up some of the functions including the push of eligible characters into a new array, and then at the very end trying to combine a math.random function and a forLoop to generate the proper string length.
